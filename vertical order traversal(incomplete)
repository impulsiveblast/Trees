//vertical order traversal of the binary tree
//instead of vector<int> v[k] i.e vector of vectors we use map<int,vector,int>> m 
//as we dont exactly know no of int values in the mapping 

//diffrence between array of vectors and mapping and integer with vector is: in mapping negative numbers can also be used also..the mapping can help in dynamic storage of integers (i.e. here nodes in vectors)



//value corresponding to each horizontal distance from main root node is stored in vectors and all vectors printed at the end 
//this ensures printing numbers on basis of left to right traversal of all elements in vertical line passing through each horizontal distance
